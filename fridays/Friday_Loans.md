# Friday Loans



You can earn up to 30xp.

Due by October 14th



The task is to create a classifier to determine whether someone qualifies for a loan or not.  There are two files:

* [loan_train.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/data/loan_train.csv)

* [loan_test.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zacharski/ml-class/master/data/loan_test.csv)



The column you are predicting in the training data is Loan_Status. This column does not exist in the test file. 



This task combines what you learned in a number of labs. You are free to use whatever classifier you want.  Remember, that you can experiment with adjusting hyperparameters. For example, if you select decision trees, you can experiment with the maximum depth.



### Deliverables

There are two deliverables:

* a Python notebook showing your work in developing a classifier and tuning it. 

* a text file containing your predictions.



#### The Python notebook.

The notebook should contain a combination of text and code cells that clearly shows the process you went through to select the classifier and hyperparameters you used. I will rate this on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0.



#### The text file.

The text file will contain your predictions on the test data. The format needs to be



```
0
0
1
0
1
1
...
```



where 0 indicates the loan is note approved and 1 indicates it has been approved.  Since I automatically grade this it is important that you follow this format. There are 30 entries in the test file. The xp you get is the number correct times the score on your Python notebook.  For example, if you get 25 predictions correct and the score on your notebook is 0.75 your score will be 19.
