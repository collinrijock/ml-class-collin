You are to suggest a classifier and give a 3-4 sentence statement as to why it is a good choice.

## College First Year Cohorts (4xp)

A small liberal arts college has 400 incoming students that they would like to divide into 20 cohorts to augment the students' first year experiences. To help with this division, the students completed a 50 question questionaire that includes questions on

* academic interests (likely major, course interests)

* hobbies

* sports played

* foreign languages 

* high school experiences

What method can we use to divide the students into cohorts? (3-4 sentences please)

Two questions:

1. What data preparation do we need to do? (4xp)

2. What method should we use to predict Box_Office. (4xp)

Remember to answer each using multiple sentences.



## Will a graduate make more than $50k a year? (4xp)
